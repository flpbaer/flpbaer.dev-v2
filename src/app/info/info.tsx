        <p>
          A significant part of my early journey at Segalas involved learning
          how to apply programming skills in real-world applications. I began
          with foundational projects using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Over time,
          I transitioned to React, where I built my stack and played a key role
          in developing an ecommerce platform from the ground up, which I
          continue to maintain today. At Segalas, I work as a full-cycle
          developer, primarily focused on front-end development.

        <br />
        <p>
          My work includes software development and the creation of interactive
          interfaces, leveraging agile methodologies and modern technologies. I
          specialize in front-end development using React with TypeScript,
          Tailwind CSS, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, I
          incorporate UI/UX design principles using Figma and ensure seamless
          deployment through CI/CD pipelines.

        <p>
          I worked as an IT assistant, focused only on taking courses, I didnâ€™t
          work directly at the company.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I delved deeper into web development and introduction to computer
          networks courses. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, I was
          introduced to the world of networks using CISCO services, how
          communication between servers works, I created connections, etc.
